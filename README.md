Readme for Data Visualization Projects on GitHub

Thank you for visiting my GitHub repository! In this repository, you will find three data visualization projects that I have completed using Power BI. These projects showcase my skills as a data analyst and demonstrate my ability to clean and analyze data using Excel before importing it into Power BI for visualization.

Project Details

1. Honeywell Delivery Report:
   - This project focuses on analyzing delivery data for Honeywell, a company that specializes in manufacturing and engineering products. The report provides insights into delivery performance, including delivery times, delays, and customer satisfaction.
   - The data for this project was cleaned and processed using Excel before being imported into Power BI for visualization.

2. Myntra Ecommerce Store Sale and Profit Report:
   - This project revolves around analyzing sales and profit data for an ecommerce store called Myntra. The report aims to provide insights into sales trends, product performance, and profitability.
   - Similar to the previous project, the data for this project was cleaned and processed using Excel before being imported into Power BI for visualization.

3. Super Store Sales Report:
   - This project focuses on analyzing sales data for a fictional superstore. The report provides insights into sales performance across different regions, product categories, and customer segments.
   - As with the other projects, the data for this project was cleaned and processed using Excel before being imported into Power BI for visualization.

Skills and Tools Used

To complete these projects, I utilized various skills and tools commonly used by data analysts, including:

- Excel: I performed data cleaning and preprocessing tasks using Excel. This involved tasks such as removing duplicates, handling missing values, and transforming data into a suitable format for analysis.
- Power BI: I imported the cleaned data from Excel into Power BI to create interactive and visually appealing data visualizations. Power BI allows for the creation of interactive dashboards, reports, and visualizations that can be shared with others.

How to Use the Projects

To explore these projects and view the visualizations, follow these steps:

1. Clone or download the repository to your local machine.
2. Open Power BI Desktop on your computer.
3. In Power BI Desktop, select "Open" and navigate to the location where you cloned or downloaded the repository.
4. Open the Power BI file (.pbix) corresponding to the project you wish to explore.
5. Once the file is open, you can interact with the visualizations, explore the data, and gain insights from the reports.

Feel free to reach out to me if you have any questions or feedback regarding these projects. I hope you find them informative and insightful!

Note: If you encounter any issues with data import or visualization, please ensure that you have the necessary software and dependencies installed. Power BI can import data from various sources, including Excel and CSV files If you need assistance with importing data into Power BI or any other aspect of the projects, feel free to ask for help.

Happy exploring!
